Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the applicaton of engineering princples to the development and maintenance of high quality software
It enables creation of software applications that pwer various aspects of mordern life like healthcare
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of AI

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:This is where one gathers and documents user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating a software architecture and user interphase
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential design with distinct phases while agile methodology uses interactive increamental approach focused on collaboration, flexibility and respond to change. Waterfall methodology would be appropriate when working on a project as an individual while agile methodology is most appropriate when working in groups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: They are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer: assures quality by designning and executing test plans.
Project manager: They oversee the planning, execution and delivery of the software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's are comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing out code. e.g Visual Studio code.
VSC's are software toos for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced by software engineers are:
Challenging requirements; it can be overcome by reassessment of project goals
Technical deadlines; it can be resolved by prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: It focuses on individual components of the software. It hels catch bugs in the early stages of development cycle.
Integration testing: It tests how different modules of software work together. It identifies integration issues early.
System testing: It evaluates the entire application as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It verifies the whole system behaves as intended.
Acceptance testing: It validates the system against business requirements and the final phase before the products are deliverd to the customer. It ensures it is ready for production and meets the clients requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting quations in a way that helps get the best response from AI
Prompt engineering helps to improve interactions with AI.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Tell me about Kenya"
Improved prompt "Tell me about Kenya focusing on the political side from when they were colonized to when they got their independence"
The vague prompt would have given all the facts about Kenya most not relevant to the question but the improved one gives a clear detailed answer.
